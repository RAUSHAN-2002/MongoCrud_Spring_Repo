MongoNestRepository is a Spring Boot-based application designed for seamless and efficient interaction with MongoDB. This project showcases a robust architecture incorporating multiple layers—DTO, Service, Controller, and Repository—ensuring clean code and maintainability.

Key Features:
CRUD Operations:
Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations with MongoDB's document-based data model.

Pagination and Sorting:
Efficiently handle large datasets by implementing pagination and sorting, allowing users to retrieve data in manageable chunks, sorted in ascending or descending order.

Validation:
Leverages DTO-based validation to ensure data integrity, with meaningful error messages for invalid inputs.

Exception Handling:
Implements a global exception handling mechanism to capture and manage application errors gracefully, providing detailed error responses to the client.

Layered Architecture:

DTO Layer: Handles data transfer between the application and the client.
Service Layer: Encapsulates business logic and orchestrates data flow.
Controller Layer: Manages API endpoints and handles incoming requests.
Repository Layer: Interacts directly with MongoDB for database operations.
Technology Stack:
Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Data MongoDB
Database: MongoDB
Tools: Maven, IntelliJ IDEA
Build Tool: maven
Usage:
This repository is perfect for developers looking for a well-structured example of a MongoDB integration with Spring Boot, complete with modern best practices like validation, exception handling, and pagination.
